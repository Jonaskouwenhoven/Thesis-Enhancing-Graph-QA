A barn is defined as \(10^{-28} m^2 (100 fm^2)\) and is approximately the cross sectional area of a uranium nucleus.

In the International System of Units the tex is used instead (see below). The denier is based on a natural standard: a single strand of silk is approximately one denier. A 9,000-meter strand of silk weighs about one gram. The term denier is from the French denier, a coin of small value (worth 1/12 of a sou). Applied to yarn, a denier was held to be equal in weight to 1/24 of an ounce. The term microdenier is used to describe filaments that weigh less than one gram per 9,000 meter length.

Very early in the study of electricity scientists discovered that a pair of conductors separated by an insulator can store a much larger charge than an isolated conductor can store. The better the insulator, the larger the charge that the conductors can hold. This property of a circuit is called capacitance, and it is measured in farads. One farad is defined as the ability to store one coulomb of charge per volt of potential difference between the two conductors. This is a natural definition, but the unit it defines is very large. In practical circuits, capacitance is often measured in microfarads, nanofarads, or sometimes even in picofarads (10-12 farad, or trillionths of a farad). The unit is named for the British physicist Michael Faraday (1791-1867), who was known for his work in electricity and electrochemistry.

The name comes from the Greek gramma, a small weight identified in later Roman and Byzantine times with the Latin scripulum or scruple (the English scruple is equal to about 1.3 grams). The gram was originally defined to be the mass of one cubic centimeter of pure water, but to provide precise standards it was necessary to construct physical objects of specified mass. One gram is now defined to be 1/1000 of the mass of the standard kilogram, a platinum-iridium bar carefully guarded by the International Bureau of Weights and Measure in Paris for more than a century. (The kilogram, rather than the gram, is considered the base unit of mass in the SI.) The gram is a small mass, equal to about 15.432 grains or 0.035 273 966 ounce.

A changing magnetic field induces an electric current in a loop of wire (or in a coil of many loops) located in the field. Although the induced voltage depends only on the rate at which the magnetic flux changes, measured in webers per second, the amount of the current depends also on the physical properties of the coil. A coil with an inductance of one henry requires a flux of one weber for each ampere of induced current. If, on the other hand, it is the current which changes, then the induced field will generate a potential difference within the coil: if the inductance is one henry a current change of one ampere per second generates a potential difference of one volt. The henry is a large unit; inductances in practical circuits are measured in millihenrys (mH) or microhenrys (u03bc H). The unit is named for the American physicist Joseph Henry (1797-1878), one of several scientists who discovered independently how magnetic fields can be used to generate alternating currents. \(\text{H} \; \equiv \; \text{henry}\; \equiv\; \frac{\text{Wb}}{\text{A}}\; \equiv\; \frac{\text{weber}}{\text{amp}}\; \equiv\ \frac{\text{V}\cdot\text{s}}{\text{A}}\; \equiv\; \frac{\text{volt} \cdot \text{second}}{\text{amp}}\; \equiv\ \Omega\cdot\text{s}\; \equiv\; \text{ohm.second}\)

However, due to variations in the rotation rate of the Earth, the rate of an ideal sidereal clock deviates from any simple multiple of a civil clock. In practice, the difference is kept track of by the difference UTC-UT1, which is measured by radio telescopes and kept on file and available to the public at the IERS and at the United States Naval Observatory. A Sidereal Hour is \(1/24^{th}\) of a Sidereal Day. A mean sidereal day is 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.0916 seconds (23.9344699 hours or 0.99726958 mean solar days), the time it takes Earth to make one rotation relative to the vernal equinox. (Due to nutation, an actual sidereal day is not quite so constant.) The vernal equinox itself precesses slowly westward relative to the fixed stars, completing one revolution in about 26,000 years, so the misnamed sidereal day ("sidereal" is derived from the Latin sidus meaning "star") is 0.0084 seconds shorter than Earth's period of rotation relative to the fixed stars.

The intensity of a magnetic field can be measured by placing a current-carrying conductor in the field. The magnetic field exerts a force on the conductor, a force which depends on the amount of the current and on the length of the conductor. One tesla is defined as the field intensity generating one newton of force per ampere of current per meter of conductor. Equivalently, one tesla represents a magnetic flux density of one weber per square meter of area. A field of one tesla is quite strong: the strongest fields available in laboratories are about 20 teslas, and the Earth's magnetic flux density, at its surface, is about 50 microteslas. The tesla, defined in 1958, honors the Serbian-American electrical engineer Nikola Tesla (1856-1943), whose work in electromagnetic induction led to the first practical generators and motors using alternating current. \(T =  V\cdot s \cdot m^{-2} = N\cdot A^{-1}\cdot m^{-1} = Wb\cdot m^{-1} = kg \cdot  C^{-1}\cdot s^{-1}\cdot A^{-1} = kg \cdot s^{-2}\cdot A^{-1} = N \cdot s \cdot C^{-1}\cdot m^{-1}\) where, \(\\\) \(A\) = ampere, \(C\)=coulomb, \(m\) = meter,  \(N\) = newton, \(s\) = second, \(T\) = tesla, \(Wb\) = weber

    WB = URIRef("http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/WB")  # The SI unit of magnetic flux. "Flux" is the rate (per unit of time) at which something crosses a surface perpendicular to the flow. The weber is a large unit, equal to \(10^{8}\) maxwells, and practical fluxes are usually fractions of one weber. The weber is the magnetic flux which, linking a circuit of one turn, would produce in it an electromotive force of 1 volt if it were reduced to zero at a uniform rate in 1 second. In SI base units, the dimensions of the weber are \((kg \cdot m^2)/(s^2 \cdot A)\). The weber is commonly expressed in terms of other derived units as the Tesla-square meter (\(T \cdot m^2\)), volt-seconds (\(V \cdot s\)), or joules per ampere (\(J/A\)).

Because of the precession of the equinoxes, the seasonal cycle does not remain exactly synchronised with the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun. As a consequence, the tropical year is about 20 minutes shorter than the time it takes Earth to complete one full orbit around the Sun as measured with respect to the fixed stars. Since antiquity, astronomers have progressively refined the definition of the tropical year, and currently define it as the time required for the mean Sun's tropical longitude (longitudinal position along the ecliptic relative to its position at the vernal equinox) to increase by 360 degrees (that is, to complete one full seasonal circuit).</p>
